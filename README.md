# Lively4

It's all new and will be totally awesome! And we did not talk about it yet.... but we should.

We decided to use a [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/LivelyKernel/Lively4/wiki/Home) as a center for documentation and discussion of design ideas decisions. 

The current development of Livley 4 can be tried out (and contribituted) on a github.io page: 
https://livelykernel.github.io/lively4-core/draft/test.html which is an automatic view into the (gh-pages branch of lively-core)[https://github.com/LivelyKernel/lively4-core/tree/gh-pages].

Currently, the test pages and the core is cramed together, but we will pull them appart as soon as the core will stabalize and we can use it to host and edit arbitraty content from GitHub repositories.
